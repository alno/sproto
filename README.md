SProto library
==============

SProto is library for Scala which allows to write/read data structures using different protocols.
It's like [sbinary](https://github.com/harrah/sbinary) or [sjson](https://github.com/debasishg/sjson) but with no hard-coded data format.

Installation
------------

Motivation
----------

It allows you to describe new protocols and new data structure handling rules independently.

Protocols
---------

Implemented protocols:
* MongoDB objects (based on [mongo-java-driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver))

Planned:
* JSON objects
* Basic map/list objects
* JSON string with no intermediate objects
* MessagePack binaries

Concepts
--------


### Writing

**Writer** - something to there data can be written

**MapWriter** - something to there key-value pairs can be written

**SeqWriter** - something to there sequence of elements can be written

**WriteProtocol** - a set of rules for writing data to specific writers

### Reading

**Reader** - something from where data can be read

**MapReader** - something from there key-value pairs can be read

**SeqReader** - something from there sequence of elements can be read

**ReadProtocol** - a set of rules for reading data from specific readers
